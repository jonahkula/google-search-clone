# Google Search Clone

Fully responsive google search clone using the Google API

## Running and Testing

To run, set up API keys and use command `npm run dev`

When testing, make sure to set _useDummyData_ to _true_ so that you don't use up
the quota for a limited amount of searches per day from Google's API
